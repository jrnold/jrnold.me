I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the
[University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/new-site/)
and an Instructor of Political Science at [Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/).
My areas of study are statistical methods and international relations. 

Prior to starting at Rochester, I worked as a Research Associate and
Economist in the
[Money and Payments Studies](http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/payments_research/index.html)
research group at the
[Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/)
where I did some work on systemic financial risk.
