I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the
[University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/new-site/).
My areas of study are statistical methods, formal theory, and
international relations. Currently I am a pre-doctoral fellow at the
[QuantTM](http://www.quantitative.emory.edu/) (Institute for
Quantitative Theory and Methods) at Emory University.

Prior to starting at Rochester, I worked as a Research Associate and
Economist in the
[Money and Payments Studies](http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/payments_research/index.html)
research group at the
[Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/).
