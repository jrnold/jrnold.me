## Pricing the Costly Lottery:

**Financial Market Reactions to Battlefield Events in the American Civil War**
      
What role does combat play in resolving the disagreement that
initiated war? Bargaining theories of war propose two mechanisms, the
destruction of capabilities and the revelation of private information.
These mechanisms are difficult to analyze quantitatively because the
mechanisms are observationally equivalent, the participants'
expectations are unobservable, and there is a lack of data on battles.
With new methods and new data on the American Civil War, I address
these challenges. I estimate the information revealed by combat with a
model of Bayesian learning. I use prices of Union and Cnnnonfederate
currencies to measure public expectations of war duration and outcome.
Data on battlefield events come from detailed data on the outcomes and
casualties of the battles of the American Civil War. The results
suggest that battle outcomes rather than casualties or information
revelation had the largest influence on the expected duration of the
American Civil War.

## 	Civil War as a Hidden Markov Model

This paper estimates a model of civil war prevalence with a hidden
Markov model (HMM) to account for measurement error in classifying
civil wars. Since there exist multiple coding rules for civil war with
substantial disagreement, each of these coding rules is treated as a
noisy indicator of a latent concept. A HMM is used to classify
country-years into latent states of civil war and peace and to model
the probability of civil war onset and continuation with these latent
states. The estimated classification supports an inclusive concept of
civil war with a low threshold for what constitutes a civil war. The
only statistically significant covariates in the civil war transition
models are population and GDP on civil war onset.

## Producing Death:

**Estimating the Offense-Defense Balance from the Production Function of Battle Casualties**

250 years ago wars were fought with muskets. Today they are fought
with missiles. Yet most empirical and theoretical literature has
treated war as a homogeneous process across time. This paper develops
a theoretical and quantitative apparatus to describe a key source of
heterogeneity in wars, the technology of combat. The technology of
combat is the shape of the function that takes military forces as
inputs and produces casualties as its outputs, i.e. the production
function of war. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, I estimate the
coefficients of this function at the war level. These estimates
provide theoretically derived empirical estimates of the
offense-defense balance and the relationship between the quantity and
quality of forces over time and across wars

## Uncertainty in Military Capabilities and its Effects on Conflict Initiation

Uncertainty and private information military capabilities is one of
the primary causal mechanisms of war initiation in rationalist
theories war. However, by their very nature, uncertainty and private
information are hard to quantify. Most previous attempts to quantify
ex ante uncertainty use equality in military capabilities to proxy for
military uncertainty. However, this definition is not a direct measure
of military uncertainty. This work develops a direct measure of ex
ante military uncertainty using a Bayesian measurement model that
combines indicators of measurement error and discrepancies in data on
military personnel and expenditures from the Correlates of War, SIPRI,
WMEAT and other sources. To understand the effect of military
capability uncertainty on conflict initiation this new measure of
uncertainty is included as an explanatory variable in a model of MID
initiations.
