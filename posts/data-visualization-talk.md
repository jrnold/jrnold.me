I gave at teaching presentation talk to the Emory University Political
Science Department for a post-doctoral position in methods. The talk
was supposed to be a lecture from an undergraduate political science
introductory statistics course. I used it as an opportunity to
coalesce some thoughts I've had on data visualization, why its used,
why it works, and how it relates to statistics (influenced by 
Cleveland, Gelman, and Wickham).

I also strayed from LaTeX/Beamer for the first time in a long time, 
and tried out one of the HTML slideshow tools, namely,
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). It was pretty slick.
