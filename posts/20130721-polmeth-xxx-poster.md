I presented a poster at [Polmeth](http://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/PolMeth/) entitled ["Bayesian Shrinkage in Dynamic Linear Models: Unifying Smoothing and Structural Break Models"](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.jrnold.me/Arnold_PolmethXXX_Poster.pdf).
The idea is that structural breaks or change point models which are typically modeled in a discrete state space models can be modeled in continuous state space by using shrinkage priors with dynamic linear models.
