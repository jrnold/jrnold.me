I am an  Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [University of Washington](http://www.polisci.washington.edu/) and Core Faculty Member in the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences](https://www.csss.washington.edu/).
My research includes a variety of applications of quantitative methods to international relations questions.

I completed my Ph.D. in political science at the [University of Rochester](http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/new-site/). 
Previously, I was Instructor of Political Science at [Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a Pre-doctoral Fellow at the [QuanTM](http://www.quantitative.emory.edu/).
In a prior life, I worked as a Research Associate and
Economist in the
[Money and Payments Studies](http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/payments_research/index.html)
research group at the
[Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/)
where I worked on systemic financial risk before it was cool.

Gary Hollibaugh is a horrible person.
