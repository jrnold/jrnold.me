How do the characteristics of military leaders relate to battlefield outcomes? To answer
this question, we employ original battle-level data and biographical information on hundreds
of commanders in more than 250 battles in the American Civil War. We examine the relationship
between two common measures of battlefield success (victory and casualties) and
two latent features of commanders—competence and loyalty—that have long been seen as
important in the broader study of executive appointments. We find that competent commanders
are associated with more successful battlefield outcomes, as are more loyal Confederate
commanders. More broadly, our analysis suggests that focusing on the relationship between
military appointments and battlefield outcomes—with the latter’s relatively clear definition
of “success”—allows for direct examination of the relationship between appointee traits and
organizational performance. As such, our results have implications for the study of conflict as
well as bureaucratic politics.
