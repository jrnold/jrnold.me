This paper estimates a model of civil war prevalence with a hidden
Markov model (HMM) to account for measurement error in classifying
civil wars. Since there exist multiple coding rules for civil war with
substantial disagreement, each of these coding rules is treated as a
noisy indicator of a latent concept. A HMM is used to classify
country-years into latent states of civil war and peace and to model
the probability of civil war onset and continuation with these latent
states. The estimated classification supports an inclusive concept of
civil war with a low threshold for what constitutes a civil war. The
only statistically significant covariates in the civil war transition
models are population and GDP on civil war onset.
