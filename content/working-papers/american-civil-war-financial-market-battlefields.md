title: "Pricing the Costly Lottery: Financial Market Reactions to Battlefield Events in the American Civil War"
---

This paper estimates the effects of major battles in the American
Civil War on the price of Union bonds.  Bond prices are a function of
expected future cash flows, and war results can have a large influence
on the the expectation of the timely payment of those cash flows.
Thus, bond prices provide a method to assess the effects of war events
on the expected war result.  This allows for understanding how events
within war influenced the expected war result.  Assessing the
importance of war events on war termination provides another method
for researchers to &ldquo;open up the black box of war&rdquo;.  In this
application, initial results suggest that for the Union bonds
considered, the average Confederate victory decreased the price by
3.3% Union victory increased it by 1%.
