title: Producing Death: Estimating the Offense-Defense Balance from the Production Function of Battle Casualties
---

250 years ago wars were fought with muskets. Today they are fought
with missiles. Yet most empirical and theoretical literature has
treated war as a homogeneous process across time. This paper develops
a theoretical and quantitative apparatus to describe a key source of
heterogeneity in wars, the technology of combat. The technology of
combat is the shape of the function that takes military forces as
inputs and produces casualties as its outputs, i.e. the production
function of war. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, I estimate the
coefficients of this function at the war level. These estimates
provide theoretically derived empirical estimates of the
offense-defense balance and the relationship between the quantity and
quality of forces over time and across wars
