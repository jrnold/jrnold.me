abstract: >

  I estimate the market implied ex ante probability of the onset of   the
  American Civil War using U.S. government and state bonds. Surprisingly,
  financial markets were surprised by the Battle of Fort Sumter and the start
  of the war. Prior to Abraham Lincolnâ€™s election in November 1860, the market
  assigned almost no probability to a war. Even after the secession of several
  states, the week before the Battle of Fort Sumter, the market assigned a
  negligible probability, approximately 5%, to war onset.
