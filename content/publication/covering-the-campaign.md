  Scholars of democratic politics differ in their conceptualization of the role
  of media in political campaigns and how it subsequently affects political
  behavior and electoral outcomes. There is therefore no consistent theoretical
  framework to guide defining, measuring, and analyzing election coverage,
  particularly in emerging democracies. We apply topic models and supervised
  learning methods to a news corpus of almost 100,000 news articles and
  approximately 137,000 tweets from South Africa’s 2014 election. We use a
  theoretically informed classification of election coverage to demonstrate how
  variation in “narrow” or “broad” conceptions of elections generate variation
  in codings of coverage of campaign events and activities reported in the
  media. Our analysis results in radically distinct representations of
  political actors and institutions in the electoral landscape: a narrow
  classification includes cues to race, party, and incumbent performance in
  coverage; a broad definition reflects public policy concerns and service
  delivery outcomes. Further, examining messaging directly from political
  actors on social media, we find social media messages by and large reflect
  the news reported in traditional media and further demonstrate politicians’
  diverse appeals. We discuss the challenges and opportunities our research and
  method pose for how scholars conceive of media’s role in elections based on
  their theoretical priors about the form, content, and impact of campaigns in
  emerging democracies. Our results also provide methods, evidence, and lessons
  learned for replication to study (electoral and non-electoral) events in
  other developing country settings.
