  We explore the network topology of the interbank payments transferred between
  commercial banks over the Fedwire Funds Service. We find that the network has
  both a low average path length and low connectivity. The network includes a
  tightly connected core of banks to which most other banks connect. The degree
  distribution is scale free over a substantial range. We find that the
  properties of the network changed considerably in the immediate aftermath of
  the events of September 11, 2001.
