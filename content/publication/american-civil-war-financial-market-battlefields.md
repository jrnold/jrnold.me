  This paper estimates the effects of major battles in the American
  Civil War on the price of Union bonds.  Bond prices are a function of
  expected future cash flows, and war results can have a large influence
  on the the expectation of the timely payment of those cash flows.
  Thus, bond prices provide a method to assess the effects of war events
  on the expected war result.  This allows for understanding how events
  within war influenced the expected war result.  Assessing the
  importance of war events on war termination provides another method
  for researchers to &ldquo;open up the black box of war&rdquo;.  In this
  application, initial results suggest that for the Union bonds
  considered, the average Confederate victory decreased the price by
  3.3% Union victory increased it by 1%.
