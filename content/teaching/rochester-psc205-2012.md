I was a teaching assistant for this course, taught by [Curtis Signorino](http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/signorino/) in 
Spring 2012. I was responsible for planning and teaching weekly lab
sessions and writing and grading weekly homework assignments.

This course used Agresti and Finlay&lsquo;s
[Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences](http://books.google.com/books?id=FMXaAAAAMAAJ).
Since this course used *R*, I wrote a package [smss](https://github.com/jrnold/r-smss) which
contains the datasets used in the book.
